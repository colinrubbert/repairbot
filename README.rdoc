== RepairBot

The best way to keep track of your customer's device repairs.

Having a lack of software in the industry suited for doing device repairs, RepairBot was born.

The goal of RepairBot is to provide a solution for single person to medium sized businesses and everything in between that focus on tablet, cell phone, laptop, desktop, and other miscellaneous electronic device repairs. RepairBot is designed with functionality and simplicity in mind.

RepairBot is a passion project created by Colin Rubbert and IT Systems Administrator and Full Stack Web Developer.
